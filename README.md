# 🍽️ Babel Bites – Webpack Practice Project

Welcome to **Babel Bites**, a minimalist restaurant website built to get hands-on practice with **Webpack**.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum and focuses on learning how to use Webpack for modular JavaScript development, asset bundling, and CSS handling.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

- Understand and configure Webpack from scratch
- Use modular JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- Bundle CSS using Webpack's `style-loader` and `css-loader`
- Organize project structure for scalability

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- Webpack 5
- CSS3

## 🧰 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Akshat041/Restaurant-Page-webpack.git
cd Restaurant-Page-webpack
2. Install Dependencies
bash

Edit
npx webpack
This will generate the bundled main.js in the dist/ folder.

4. Open in Browser
Open dist/index.html manually in your browser, or use a local server (like Live Server in VS Code).

🚀 Features
Modular code structure with ES6 export/import

Page switching using simple DOM logic

CSS bundled and applied using Webpack

Minimal design with a clean developer-friendly theme

🔧 Webpack Highlights
Custom webpack.config.js setup

CSS handled via:

bash
Copy

npm install -D style-loader css-loader
Entry point: src/index.js

Output bundled to: dist/main.js
